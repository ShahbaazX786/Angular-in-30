## Angular
---
#### Why Angular?
- Angular is a framework used to build client side apps.
- It is a great option to build SPA(Single Page Application).
- A single page app is a webapp where parts of the page gets /refreshed re-rendered asyncly without having to reload the whole page/website.
- If you want to rely completely on js/ts then angular is a great option.
- Angular follows a modular approach which helps in managing any complex app easier.
- Due to modularity and components we can heavily reuse our code.
- Angular has inbuilt features like routing,validation etc which makes development easier.
- Angular makes it possible to write unit testable and maintainable code.(Via karma,jest etc).
- Angular is a product from Google's team and it uses Microsoft's Typescript in case you like brand value more.

#### Version Changes:
- Google Decided that it will push 2 upgrades of Angular with semantic versioning.
- Semantic versioning === x.y.z
```
Where x = major upgrade(Which can introduce breaking changes).
      y = minor upgrade(These upgrades adds features which don't break any functionality).
      z = patch upgrade(These upgrades will add security patches, bug-fixes and other smaller fixes only).
```
- Due to this versioning style you can expect a new angular version in every 2 years.

#### Pre-requisites:
- Well if you are hoping to learn any framework you should be having your basics clear in below concepts
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Basic Javascript
4. Typescript (We can do with basics for a beginner).
> Note: Any tech can be hard and painful at first but if you understand it slowly and absorb all concepts at your own pace.

###### Life-Lesson:
- Life is a Sigle Player Game don't compare with others and make it a Multiplayer only to end up depressed easily.


#### Dev Environment Setup:
- Install Node and npm will be automatically installed (use **[NVM](../NVM/nvm.md)** its 2023 now).
- Install Vs code editor
- **[Angular CLI](../Angular-CLI/angular-cli.md)** (Command Line Interface).(If we know some commands then we are good to go)
- After installing all of these check their versions as ```node -v```, ```npm -v```, ```ng version``` etc.
